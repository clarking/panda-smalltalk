/* Pointer Array
 * *************
 *
 * This type is meant to provide an automatically growing array of
 * pointers, to be used by various software. It is somewhat equivalent
 * to GPtrArray in GNU glib; however, several pieces of functionality
 * are not implemented as they were not needed for the particular
 * project at hand.
 *
 * Structure:
 * 
 *     The library is built to allow for multiple references to be
 *     able to point at the array, even if the array is enlarged (and
 *     as a side effect, moved around memory) multiple times. Arrays
 *     currently cannot be shrunk - it is recommended that an array be
 *     destroyed and recreated if its space requirements decrease
 *     dramatically.
